# Uniface README

This is a **VSCode plugin** for the **Uniface** programming language. It provides **syntax highlighting**, **autocomplete**, and several **developer-friendly features**, enhancing the development experience within Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Improves code readability with proper syntax coloring.
- **Autocomplete**: Smart suggestions to speed up coding.
- **Function Navigation**: Use `Ctrl+Click` to quickly jump to `operations`, `entries`, `functions`, or `triggers`.
- **Sidebar Explorer**: Dedicated Uniface panel listing all declared `operations`, `entries`, `functions`, and `triggers`.
- **GOLD Key Support**: Recognizes `GOLD` key combinations (e.g., `+;`) and replaces them with the appropriate control characters (e.g., ASCII 27).
- **Code Formatting**: Format Uniface code using `Alt+Shift+F`.
- **VSCode Integration**: Leverages native VSCode tools with full Uniface language support.

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code** installed (minimum recommended version: 1.98.0)
